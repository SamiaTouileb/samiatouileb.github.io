Prior to this I was a Postdoc at the [Language Technology Group](https://www.mn.uio.no/ifi/english/research/groups/ltg/) (LTG), Department of Informatics, at the University of Oslo. I have a PhD in Natural Language Processing (NLP) from the University of Bergen.

My main research interests are bias and fairness in NLP, information extraction, summarization, and applications of NLP and machine learning methods to tasks within social science research. I also mainly work on under- and mid-resourced languages.
